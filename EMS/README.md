## Git Workflow

```
main          ← stable, working code only
  └── dev     ← integration branch (merge here first)
        ├── feature-kalid-database
        ├── feature-member2-auth
        ├── feature-member3-employee
        ├── feature-member4-department
        └── feature-member5-ui
```

**Daily workflow:**
```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout feature-kalid-database
git merge dev
# ... do your work ...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add DBConnection singleton"
git push origin feature-kalid-database
# then open a Pull Request into dev on GitHub
```

## Rules for Contributors

- ✅ Each member must work on their own branch
- ✅ Do **NOT** push directly to `main` or `dev`
- ✅ Write meaningful commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`)
- ✅ Create a Pull Request before merging
- ✅ Pull from `dev` before starting each work session
- ❌ Do not edit files owned by another member without discussing first
- ❌ Do not commit the `out/` folder (compiled files — it's in `.gitignore`)
